#### 1. Test approach

##### 1.1 Description

Buggy cars rating, is a website where fan vehicles can rate a range of luxurious cars, Users can view and rate multiple car makes and models. 

##### 1.2 Test Approach 

In order to test Buggy cars rating website I am following the ACC (Attribute, component, capability) testing approach, this approach was design by google and its primary objective is to test capabilities over features, I personally find this approach very useful since it helps the team to have common understanding about the product or component

> Note: <br />
> A capability is the intersection between an attribute and a component, for example we can be testing the Secure attribute of the login component, we can then say the 'Login component is Secure When un-authorized user Do NOT have access to Buggy Car ratings'    

for the testing of Buggy Car Ratings I have used the following attributes: 

- <b>Secure</b>: Focus in finding any type of vulnerability in the application 
- <b>Compliance</b>: Focus in testing any expected results or acceptance criteria
- <b>Auditable</b>: Focus in testing any transaction traceability
- <b>Accessible</b>: Focus in testing the application from the perspective of a person with different abilities   
- <b>Responsive</b>: Focus in testing the application in different browsers and screen dimensions
